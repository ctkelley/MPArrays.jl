Mulitprecision Arrays
This is the start of a package to support mulitprecision arrays. 

One example is a struct with a Float64 array A and Float32.(A). To do factor/solve you factor the Float32 array and solve with iterative refinement.

I have this working to the point where ```\``` does the right thing.

More later.
