# MultiPrecisionArrays.jl v0.0.3

## [C. T. Kelley](https://ctk.math.ncsu.edu)

__This package is nowhere close to ready for registration or release. It's public only to help me do CI and clean up the docs.__

__Please do not make PRs. If you stumble on this mess and have questions/ideas ..., raise an issue or email me at tim_kelley@ncsu.edu__

__The half precision lu is much faster with this realease. Look at _src/Factorizations/hlu_ to see the hack job I did to [generic_lu](https://github.com/JuliaLang/julia/blob/master/stdlib/LinearAlgebra/src/lu.jl).__

Nothing is in final form and I am changing the API, internal structures, exported functions/structs and all kinds of other stuff frequently. When/if I register this and announce it, then it will be time for complaints and offers to collaborate. 

This is the start of a package to support multiprecision arrays. This is for my own research right now.

## What is iterative refinement?

This package will make solving dense systems of linear equations faster by using the LU factorization and iterative refinement. It is limited to LU for now. A very generic description of this for solving a linear systrem $A x = b$ is

__IR(A, b, x)__
- $r = b - Ax$
- Factor $A = LU$ in a lower precision
- While $\|| r \||$ is too large
  - $d = (LU)^{-1} r$
  - $x = x + d$
  - $r = b - Ax$
- end




In Julia, a code to do this would solve the linear system $A x = b$ in double precision by using a
factorization in a lower precision, say single, within a residual correction iteration. 






I have this working to the point where ```\``` does the right thing.

## Dependencies

As of now you need to install these packages

- RecursiveFactorization
- SIAMFANLEquations

and use LinearAlgebra and SparseArrays from Base. I will remove SIAMFANLEquations from the list once I get a custom (for GMRES-IR) GMRES solver in here.


## I'm using this myself.

I have used this in my own work and will be adding links to that stuff as I finish it. 

I started on this package after finishing

(KEL22a) C. T. Kelley, [__Newton's Method in Mixed Precision__](https://epubs.siam.org/doi/10.1137/20M1342902), SIAM Review 35 (1998), pp 191-211. 

(KEL22b) C. T. Kelley, [__Solving Nonlinear Equations with Iterative Methods: Solvers and Examples in Julia__](https://my.siam.org/Store/Product/viewproduct/?ProductId=44313635), SIAM, Philadelphia, 2022. 

A new paper exploits most of the package. I use the examples in that paper for CI. If you do iterative refinement well, you can make half precision work far better than it did in (KEL22a). MultiPrecisionArrays drop right into the solvers in [SIAMFANLEquations.jl](https://github.com/ctkelley/SIAMFANLEquations.jl). 

(KEL23a) C. T. Kelley, [__Newton's method in three precisions__](https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.16051) 

This paper has a [repo](https://github.com/ctkelley/N3Presults) for reproducing the results with an early version of this package.


## __Interprecision transfers__:

This is not a trivial matter. I gave a talk at the XSDK-MULTIPRECISION meeting on June 15, 2023, about this issue.
